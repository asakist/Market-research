# Market-research

Project description:
You’ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so you and your partners decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions—will you be able to maintain your success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off? Your partners have asked you to prepare some market research. You have open-source data on restaurants in LA.

Project objective:
Find the most promising street to invest and what characteristics the enterprise should have.
